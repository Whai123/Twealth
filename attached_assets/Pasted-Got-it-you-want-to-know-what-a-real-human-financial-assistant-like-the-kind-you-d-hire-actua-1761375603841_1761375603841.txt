Got it — you want to know what a **real human financial assistant** (like the kind you’d hire) actually does day to day — so you can make Twealth’s AI act like that person.

Here’s the breakdown 👇

## 🧑‍💼 What a Financial Assistant Does (in real life)

A **financial assistant** is like your personal helper or junior financial manager.
They don’t make the big investment decisions (that’s for a financial advisor or CFO),
but they **organize, track, and execute** everything around your money —
so you always know where you stand and what to do next.
