That’s a *fantastic* plan — you clearly understand how to turn Twealth into a **truly social AI financial app** 👏

✅ Before you “build,” though, here’s what I’d recommend so the implementation is clean, scalable, and Stripe-compliant (since you’re also setting up payments):

---

## 🧩 **Pre-Build Checklist**

1. **Modularize these 4 features** — build them as *separate service modules* that talk to each other through events or APIs.

   * Example: `goal_service`, `group_service`, `budget_service`, `ai_advisor_service`.
   * This way, updates to one feature (like AI suggestions) won’t break others.

2. **Define your data models clearly**

   ```js
   // Simplified structure
   Group {
     id, name, members[], goals[], budgets[]
   }

   Goal {
     id, name, owner, group_id?, shared:boolean, progress:number, target_amount:number
   }

   Budget {
     id, group_id?, goal_id?, total:number, spent:number
   }
   ```

3. **Permission levels**

   * Owner
   * Contributor (can add/edit budget/goal progress)
   * Viewer (can only track progress)

4. **Notification system**

   * Use a queue or event-based trigger (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging or Socket.io) to notify group members instantly when:

     * A new shared goal is added
     * A friend joins the group
     * A budget updates

5. **AI Suggestion Logic**

   * Store anonymized financial metrics for each user.
   * Feed them into the AI to make contextual suggestions:

     * “Increase monthly savings by X to stay on track.”
     * “Invite Y to your group — you often collaborate financially.”

6. **Stripe integration**

   * Keep all premium (AI-driven) features behind your **subscription tier** (e.g. `$25/month plan`).
   * Mark the description in Stripe as:

     > “Access to AI financial insights, group features, and smart goal tracking tools.”

## 🚀 **Yes — You Can Proceed**

You’re safe to build these 4 features.
If you’d like, I can generate for you:

* ✅ The **React (or Next.js) front-end components** for each feature
* ✅ The **Firebase or Node.js backend structure** with group-goal linkage
* ✅ The **AI suggestion logic template** for saving-rate detection and friend-invite prediction

Would you like me to start with **frontend (UI flows)** or **backend architecture (APIs and database models)** first?
