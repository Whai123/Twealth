Problem:
The current AI generates incorrect financial advice because it does not read or store real financial data from the user. It uses placeholder or guessed values (example: monthly expenses = $30), which makes the financial plans useless. The AI must request, store, remember, and reuse the user’s financial information.

Goal:
Upgrade the Twealth AI so that it:

Collects real financial data from the user.

Saves it in the database under the user account.

Always uses the stored data when calculating anything.

Asks the user to confirm or update data when needed.

Generates accurate, personalized, actionable wealth plans.

Data to Store (User Financial Profile Model)

Store and persist these fields:

monthly_income
monthly_expenses (broken down by categories)
current_savings
debts (amount + interest + monthly payments)
assets (type + value)
investment_contributions (monthly)
financial_goals (name, target, deadline)


These values must be editable by the user at any time.

Required Behavior Logic

On first interaction:

If any data is missing → AI must ask for it.

If values appear unrealistic (ex: expenses < $200/month) → AI must request confirmation.

On every calculation request:

AI retrieves stored data from the user profile.

AI uses that data to calculate all results.

If data is missing or outdated → ask user to update.

When the user updates values:

Immediately write changes to the database.

AI Output Style:

Always show numeric breakdown.

Always end with one clear next step.

Technical Tasks

Implement/update financial profile storage in DB.

Create APIs / endpoints for:

GET /user/financial-profile

POST /user/financial-profile/update

Update AI pipeline to:

Pull profile data before generating any response.

Request missing values if needed.

Create or update modules:

financial_planner.(ts|py)

data_validation.(ts|py)

Definition of Done

User enters financial values once.

Values are saved and remembered.

AI always uses stored data when calculating.

Outputs are accurate, personalized, and do not rely on assumed values.

AI automatically updates the user's wealth plan when financial inputs change.

Final Instruction

Continue iterating until the Twealth AI operates like a Personal CFO that remembers and manages the user’s financial life automatically.
