Here’s a full roadmap of what data the AI should have and how to structure it 👇
🧠 1. Core Personal & Profile Data
Used for personalization and financial advice context.
Category	Example Data	Purpose
Identity	Name, Age, Country, Occupation	Helps tailor advice to local laws, currency, lifestyle
Financial Personality	Risk tolerance, Spending style (Saver/Spender/Balanced), Financial goals	Helps AI recommend suitable saving/investing strategies
Preferences	Preferred language, Currencies used, Timezone	For natural interaction and correct units
💵 2. Financial Accounts & Transactions
This is the heart of financial intelligence.
Category	Example Data	Use
Bank Accounts	Balance, Account type (checking, savings)	Track liquidity, cash flow
Income	Job income, side hustles, passive income	Identify income stability and growth
Expenses	Category, date, merchant, amount	Train AI to spot spending habits and give optimization tips
Assets	Real estate, stocks, crypto, cars	Calculate total net worth and diversification
Liabilities	Loans, credit cards, mortgages	Manage debt and give payoff strategies
Subscriptions	Netflix, Gym, Spotify, etc.	Detect recurring costs and suggest cancellations
🎯 3. Goals & Plans
Used for AI planning, prediction, and accountability.
Type	Example	How AI Uses It
Savings	“Save $5,000 for a Japan trip by June 2026”	Generates saving schedule + reminders
Investment	“Invest $200/month into index funds”	Tracks performance vs market
Debt payoff	“Pay off credit card by December”	Suggests payment strategy
Time goals	“Work only 40 hours/week”	Balances time–money optimization
📊 4. Behavioral & Time Data
Helps AI correlate spending with behavior and time usage (unique to Twealth’s design).
Category	Example	Purpose
Events	“Dinner with friends” → Expense tagged automatically	Connects lifestyle to money flow
Productivity	Work hours, free time	AI links income potential to time habits
Location (optional)	Spending by location	Detects local cost trends (e.g., cheaper groceries nearby)
🌐 5. Market & External Data (AI Context)
This data doesn’t come from the user — but it gives your AI the world awareness it needs.
Data Source	Example	Use
Exchange rates	USD→THB, BTC→USD	Real-time conversion
Inflation & Interest rates	Country-based	Adjust projections
Stock & crypto prices	Live feeds	Track portfolio performance
Tax brackets	Based on user’s country	Estimate net income after taxes
Economic events	Fed rate changes, oil price spikes	Adjust forecasts or investment advice
👥 6. Social & Collaborative Data
For Twealth’s group features.
Data	Example	Use
Shared goals	“Group trip to Japan – total budget $3,000”	Splits expenses, tracks contributions
Member roles	Owner / Contributor / Viewer	Access control
Shared transactions	Who paid, how much	Fair splitting and accountability
🧩 7. AI Learning & Feedback Loop
This layer keeps improving your AI’s recommendations.
Data	Example	Use
User feedback	“👍 / 👎 this advice helped”	Reinforcement tuning
Action outcomes	“User followed AI plan → goal achieved”	Better predictive advice
Chat summaries	Key takeaways from user–AI talks	Builds personal memory graph
⚙️ 8. Data Pipeline Architecture (Recommended)
Here’s the ideal flow for LLaMA 4 Scout inside Twealth:
User Inputs → Database (PostgreSQL / Firebase)
↓
ETL Layer → Clean, categorize, anonymize
↓
Financial Intelligence Engine (Python or Node.js)
↓
Vector Database (for semantic memory, e.g., Pinecone / Milvus)
↓
LLaMA 4 Scout (context from vector DB + real-time data APIs)
↓
User-facing AI Chat + Visualization Dashboards
🔒 9. Privacy & Security Musts
Since Twealth handles financial data, compliance and trust are critical:
Encrypt all user data (AES-256)
Use secure OAuth 2.0 for bank API integrations
Anonymize data for training
SOC 2 + GDPR compliance if scaling globally
Optional local data storage for privacy-conscious users
🧩 Summary
To make LLaMA 4 Scout truly act like your CFO-in-your-pocket, feed it:
Structured user data (income, goals, habits)
Live financial + market data
Feedback loops to learn over time
Then combine that with a vector memory system so it remembers and improves advice per user.
