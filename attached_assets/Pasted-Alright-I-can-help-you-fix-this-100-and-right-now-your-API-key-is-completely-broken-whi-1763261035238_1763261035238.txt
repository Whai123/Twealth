Alright, **I can help you fix this 100%** — and **right now your API key is completely broken**, which is why:

* your AI assistant fails
* Replit Agent keeps trying to fix frontend instead
* backend keeps crashing
* nothing works even after 10 attempts

The HUGE block of text in your input box is **NOT a valid API key** for *any* AI provider.
It MUST be removed and replaced correctly.

I’ll walk you through this **step by step**, very safely.

---

# ✅ **STEP 1 — DO NOT PRESS “SEND”**

You see that giant block inside the Agent’s text box?

```
0cAFcWeA44C0g9JyHF4z...
```

This is NOT a valid API key.
This will break your AI assistant completely.

👉 **IMPORTANT:** Delete everything in that textbox right now.

---

# ✅ **STEP 2 — Identify which AI model you're using**

Your Twealth app uses:

* **Llama 4 Scout (Groq)**
* **Sonnet 3.5 / 4.1 (Anthropic)**
* **GPT-5 (OpenAI)**
* **Opus 4.1 (Anthropic)**

So you need **3 different API keys**:

### ✔ **Groq key** (for Scout)

Starts with:

```
gsk_...
```

### ✔ **OpenAI key** (for GPT-5)

Starts with:

```
sk-...
```

### ✔ **Anthropic key** (Sonnet + Opus)

Starts with:

```
sk-ant-...
```

The key you have in the box is NONE of these.
This is the root of ALL your problems.

---

# ✅ **STEP 3 — Go to Replit → Secrets**

On the left sidebar:

**Tools → Secrets (Environment Variables)**
You will see something like:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = (broken)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = (broken)
GROQ_API_KEY = (broken)
```

### ❌ Delete any secret that contains the giant corrupted string

(even if it’s under a different name)

### ❌ Do NOT store keys inside text box or in code

ONLY inside Secrets.

---

# ✅ **STEP 4 — Add correct keys**

### 🔵 **For GPT-5 (OpenAI)**

Go to: [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
Create a key
Must look like:

```
sk-xxxxxx
```

Add it in Replit as:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

---

### 🟣 **For Scout (Groq)**

Go to: [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
Create a key
Must look like:

```
gsk_xxxxx
```

Add it as:

```
GROQ_API_KEY
```

---

### 🟡 **For Sonnet + Opus (Anthropic)**

Go to: [https://console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
Create a key
Must look like:

```
sk-ant-xxxx
```

Add it as:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

---

# ✅ **STEP 5 — Restart your server**

In the Replit shell, run:

```
kill 1
```

This reloads the env vars.

---

# ✅ **STEP 6 — Test the AI Assistant**

Now click your AI Assistant page and type:

> hello

It should respond instantly.
If it does, the fix is complete.

---

# 🧩 **Why your app failed before**

Because:

* your backend was calling GPT-5
* with a corrupted key
* so the server returned **401 Unauthorized**
* frontend errors appeared
* Replit Agent cannot detect invalid secrets
* so it keeps fixing unrelated code instead
* giving you the same result over and over

Fix the key → everything works.

---

# ⭐ If you want, I can also:

* check which of your AI calls require which key
* verify your .env schema
* confirm your backend uses correct key names
* update your server to route to Scout by default
* help insert plan-based routing with correct API keys

Just tell me:

👉 **“Check my secrets file”**
or
👉 **“Verify my backend key usage”**
or
👉 **“Help me set up Scout as default model”**
