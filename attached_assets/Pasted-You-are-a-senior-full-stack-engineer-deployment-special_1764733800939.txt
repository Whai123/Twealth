You are a senior full-stack engineer, deployment specialist, and mobile UX expert.

Your mission:
FIX ALL PROBLEMS shown in both screenshots.

==========================================
PART A — FIX PIC 1 (MIME ERROR + MOBILE UI)
==========================================

ISSUE 1: MIME ERROR
- Fix the error: "'text/html' is not a valid JavaScript MIME type."
- Ensure the server or hosting platform serves JS files using the correct MIME type.
- Fix routing so HTML fallback is not served in place of JavaScript bundles.
- Validate build output (Next.js, Vite, React, or whatever stack I’m using).
- Ensure CDN caching or rewrites are not causing HTML → JS mix-ups.
- Fix production build configuration and ensure correct content-type headers.

ISSUE 2: MOBILE ERROR PAGE LAYOUT
- Redesign the error page to fit mobile properly.
- Add iOS safe-area padding.
- Center the card vertically and horizontally.
- Resize buttons to proper mobile tap-size (min 44px).
- Adjust spacing, reduce oversized gaps, improve visual hierarchy.
- Fix dark mode contrast.
- Make the error page responsive, clean, and modern.

==========================================
PART B — FIX PIC 2 (PRICING PAGE)
==========================================

The pricing page should show EXACTLY **3 plans**:

1. Free
2. Twealth Pro — $9.99/month
3. Twealth Enterprise — $49.99/month

CURRENT PROBLEMS:
- Duplicate “Free” plan is showing.
- Pro and Enterprise are not aligned or properly displayed.
- Some features/quotas are wrong or mismatched.
- Desktop layout is squeezed into mobile view (not responsive).
- Cards have inconsistent height, spacing, alignment, and overflow issues.

FIX ALL OF THIS:

PRICING LOGIC:
- Fix the pricing data model so it only outputs 3 unique plans.
- Correct map/render logic to prevent duplication.
- Ensure pricing, quotas, and features map correctly.
- Fix conditional rendering, default states, and fallback logic.

PRICING UI:
- Make a fully responsive layout:
  • Mobile → 1 column stacked
  • Tablet → 2 columns
  • Desktop → 3 columns
- Equalize card heights.
- Fix spacing, padding, margins, and typography.
- Ensure icons align properly.
- Fix CTA buttons (width, padding, alignment).
- Improve dark mode consistency.

==========================================
PART C — GLOBAL MOBILE SUPPORT
==========================================
- Apply mobile-first breakpoints.
- Add fluid typography and spacing.
- Fix any horizontal overflow.
- Ensure all cards and containers scale properly.
- Optimize for iOS and Android safe areas.
- Improve performance and layout stability.
- Make the entire UI feel like a 2025 native app.

==========================================
DELIVERABLES
==========================================
Provide:

1. List of all root causes (for MIME, mobile layout, and pricing duplication).
2. Corrected pricing data (3 plans only).
3. Fully rewritten responsive pricing component code.
4. Fully rewritten error page component code.
5. Updated routing/build configuration for proper MIME handling.
6. Before vs After explanation.
7. Final “Mobile Ready + Bug-Free” version of both pages.

Start by saying:
“FIXING ALL ISSUES NOW — MIME, Mobile UI, and Pricing Page.”
