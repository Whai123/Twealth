Excellent question — and yes 👏 those are **exactly the kinds of workflows** that would make **Twealth** feel more powerful, social, and valuable to users.

Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## 🧭 **1. Create a Goal and Automatically Share It with All Group Members**

✅ **Why it’s important:**
People often set goals together — saving for a trip, investing as a group, or paying off shared expenses.

✅ **Missing workflow:**
Currently, if Twealth requires each user to manually re-create or join a goal, that adds friction.

✅ **Ideal behavior:**

* One person creates a goal (“Save 50,000 THB for Japan Trip”).
* Chooses a group (e.g., “Friends Japan 2025”).
* Everyone in that group **automatically sees the goal**, gets updates, and can add contributions or sub-tasks.
* AI tracks progress per member.

✅ **Implementation idea:**

```
if goal.shared == True:
    notify_all(group.members)
    sync_goal_progress()
```

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **2. Bulk Invite Friends to a Group**

✅ **Why it’s important:**
Twealth can grow faster when people can invite others easily — frictionless onboarding drives network effects.

✅ **Missing workflow:**
Currently, users might have to invite people **one by one**.

✅ **Ideal behavior:**

* “Invite All” button that syncs with contacts, LINE, or Gmail.
* Sends a branded Twealth invite link (deep link to the app).
* New users automatically join the correct group upon signup.

✅ **AI enhancement:**
AI can suggest who to invite (e.g., “Would you like to add John, who’s often part of your shared budgets?”).

---

## 💰 **3. Connect Shared Budgets Directly to Group Goals**

✅ **Why it’s important:**
Budgeting and goals are usually linked — saving for something specific gives motivation.

✅ **Missing workflow:**
If budgets and goals are separate modules, users might lose context.

✅ **Ideal behavior:**

* A group can create a **shared budget** (e.g., “Travel Budget 2025 – 10,000 THB/month”).
* The AI links that to a goal (“Trip to Japan”), and auto-updates goal progress based on total group savings.
* Real-time dashboard shows everyone’s contribution.

✅ **Bonus feature:**
AI could **detect mismatches** — for example, “Your current saving rate will delay the goal by 2 months. Would you like me to adjust the plan?”
